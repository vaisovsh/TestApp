    <string name="doscription">The Great Gatsby is one of the most exciting yet sorrowful books you will ever read. The novel was published in 1925 and perfectly shows how decadent the Jazz Age was. It will teach you a valuable lesson that not everyone is fortunate in love. The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway\'s interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby\'s obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island\'s North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book\'s title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat\'s cover art greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.</string>
